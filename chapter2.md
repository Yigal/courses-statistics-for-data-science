## Classify field type #1

```yaml
type: PureMultipleChoiceExercise
key: 7c6403121c
xp: 50
```

The [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook) contains information about the countries of the world. Identify for various fields about countries which type of field they are (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio)
  
What is the field type for the **name of the currency**?

`@hint`
* Names are nominal, because they are discrete values that don't have any inherent relationship
* Ranks (1st, 2nd, 3rd) are ordinal. There is an inherent order, but addition is meaningless. There is no way, for example, to know from ranks if the first country has more or less people than the second and third countries combined.
* There is no date zero, so dates (for example, of the last election) cannot be a ratio. However, it is meaningful to subtract dates from each other. It gives us the length of time that an official or a parliament served. Therefore, it is an interval field.
* Life expectancy has a meaningful zero (stillborn, dead at birth). It is meaningful to say that the life expectancy in country A is 90% of the life expectancy in country B. Therefore, it is a ratio field.

What is the field type for the **population size rank (China first, India second, etc).**?
